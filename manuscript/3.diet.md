# Diet

Nutrition can be a squishy subject. You might be a vegetarian, vegan, or doing keto. Nutrition can be easy too! More or less, you can follow this advice to reach your goals:

> Eat 3-4 times per day, enough protein and enough calories to reach your goals

Want to lose weight? Reduce calories and lose about 1% of body weight in a week
Want to gain weight? Increase calories and increase body weight by 0.25% in a week

## What your goals should be?

For the average person, you might want to target a range of body fat percentages to be considered "athletic-looking". Let me be clear about this. You are beautiful! Most of the society associates these body fat percentages with athleticism.

Man body fat: 10-15% - visible abs

Female body fat: 20-25% - flat belly (some abs definition)

It's all about the trend (daily data points almost don't matter)

The good news is that when you build some muscle, you'll be able to eat more and not gain fat (more muscle burns more calories even when resting).
