# Diet

Eat 3-4 times per day, enough protein and enough calories

Want to lose weight? Reduce calories and lose about 1% of body weight in a week
Want to gain weight? Increase calories and increase body weight by 0.25% in a week

Man body fat: 10-15% - visible abs
Female body fat: 20-25% - flat belly (some abs definition)

It's all about the trend (daily data points almost don't matter)

## Eating healthy vs eating for results

## Losing fat and building muscle?

## Its all about the calories

## You need that protein

## Should you go Keto?

## What supplements should you take?
