# Diet

> Slow and steady wins the race. Like every time!

Nutrition can be a squishy subject. You might be a vegetarian, vegan, or doing keto. Nutrition can be easy too! More or less, you can follow this advice to reach your goals:

> Eat 3-4 times per day, enough protein and enough calories to reach your goals

You can follow those 3 simple steps to get your diet in check:

- Define your goal - cut weight, gain weight or maintain
- Calculate the calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fats you need per day
- Measure your weight daily and adjust accordingly

The good news is that when you build some muscle, you'll be able to eat more and not gain fat (more muscle burns more calories even when resting).

## How to calculate your macros?

| Goal            | Calories (kcal/lb) | Protein (grams/lb) | Carbohydrates (grams/lb) | Fat (grams/lb) |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| Weight Loss     | 11.4               | 1.2                | 1                        | 0.3            |
| Muscle Building | 15.5               | 1.05               | 1.8                      | 0.5            |
| Recomposition   | 12.7               | 1.12               | 1.22                     | 0.35           |

## What your goals should be?

For the average person, you might want to target a range of body fat percentages to be considered "athletic-looking". Let me be clear about this. You are beautiful! Most of the society associates these body fat percentages with athleticism.

Males want to be in the 10-15% body fat range. This means visible abs (not just definition). Here's an example:

If you're female, you might want to be in the 20-25%. You want to have a flat belly with some abs definition. Here's an example look of that:

Being in that of body fat range allows you to perform at or near your optimum athletic level.

## How fast/slow should you change your body weight?

Want to lose weight? Reduce calories and lose about 1% of body weight in a week
Want to gain weight? Increase calories and increase body weight by 0.25% in a week

## How can you tell you're making progress?

You wake up, take some quality time for yourself, and weigh in. You do it every day. You're on the third week of your weight loss journey. Everything went great so far. But today your weight went up - by a full pound!

What should you do? Change your diet? Do more cardio? Reduce your calories? NO! It's all about the trend (daily data points almost don't matter).

Having one or two bad days is not enough to change anything. If the situation doesn't change (or goes worse) for 4-5 days - start with walking more (doing more steps through the day), then decrease the calories, and as a last resort - increase the cardio.

## Eating healthy vs eating for results

You can lose weight eating McDonald's. You have to eat fewer calories than you burn. Should you do it? NO!

You can and should eat both healthy and targeting your goals. And come on, you know what this means. You already know that eating chips and fake looking meat are not good for you!

You already know that eating lean meat, veggies, and fruits can't be beaten. Those types of foods are timeless. Proven in time! It might be a good idea to find good sources, too!

Also, your food shouldn't be something you don't like. There are no magical foods! You should aim for variety and something you like. You don't have to eat chicken, rice, and broccoli to get jacked!

Personally, I can't get enough of some types of food. I love eating beef, Bulgarian yogurt, cheese, eggs, oats, bread, apples, oranges, bananas and multiple types of nuts. Can I get lean using those foods? Yes! Can I get fat eating those foods? Yes! Are those healthy? Absolutely!

What are your favorite foods? Can you eat those for months? Are they healthy? Are they (mostly) low on calories and high on protein?

## How often should you eat?

You can generally trust your body on this one. Eat when you feel hungry. You should aim for 3-4 meals per day. Space them out evenly.

If your body/mind fails you, leave between 3 and 5 hours between each meal.

## Can you lose fat and build muscle at the same time?

Yes and no. As a beginner, you'll look transformed every month. Losing fat and building muscle will occur in the same period. As an advanced lifter, the rate of muscle building will slow down significantly. You'll need a caloric surplus (or some of the special sauce) to make some gains.

## Its all about the calories

The way (proven by countless practitioners and some studies) to gain or lose weight is to change your daily calorie intake. Of course, you might also change the number of burnt calories per day. The famous "calories in, calories out" is the real deal!

But please, keep your protein intake high and do not go too fast when losing weight (go for 1% of your body weight per week). Do not gain weight too fast too (go for 0.25% of your body weight per week)!

## How to count calories?

There are a lot of tools out there that help you count calories. Still, the process is laborious and error-prone! The good news is that you need a rough estimate of your macros! The bad news is that it takes time to get rough estimates.

My favorite calorie counting tool is [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Of course, you can use something like MyFitnessPal or whatever you find comfortable. Make sure to keep track of your calories rigorously for at least 3-4 weeks (if you eat somewhat similar meals). After that, you'll build some intuition and probably get away without tracking on most days.

## What food should you eat?

Ok, getting to know your macros was easy. But a dieting person knows that choosing the actual foods you're going to eat is the most important part. Devil is in the detail.

You should aim for foods that are healthy (as raw as possible), filling, low in calories and are high in one of the macronutrients (this one is important). Avoid foods that are high in fats and carbohydrates! All the sweets and junk fall into that category.

Be warned. Eating junk and sweets is addicting. You'll find that after you've eaten clean for 2-3 weeks, junk food will not be that attractive. The start might be tough on you, be prepared.

## You need that protein

Whatever your diet is, you need to eat enough protein. Aim for at least 20 grams of protein per meal. Supplements might help you get enough throughout busy days.

## Should you cycle between bulking and cutting?

This is a mistake that I've done countless times in the past. You get in shape, showing some abs, the performance in the gym is great, you keep building muscle. "Oh, I should bulk up now". Next thing you know - you're fat.

Then you start "the cut". Your gym performance goes to shit, you have to do more cardio, you're feeling hungry. That sucks.

NO! Don't go through bulk and cutting cycles. Once you're lean enough, increase your calories by 100-300, and continue to do so, until your abs start to hide (visible abs for man, ab definition for women). That way, you can keep the athletic look all year round.

## Should you go Keto (or another diet)?

For the regular gym-goer, any famous diet is full of shit. You don't need to endure any torture required by some crazy diets. Whether or not you want to eat animals and animal products is an ethical decision that only you can make. I respect your choice on that one.

Eat healthy, stay in target protein, and calorie range. That way, you'll achieve your goals!

## How much water should you drink?

The average person might benefit from increasing their water intake. It might be especially beneficial when losing fat. For some, drinking water lowers their hunger. Here are some general recommendations:

- Men - about 4.2 liters / 1.1 gallons
- Women - about 3.7 liters / 0.98 gallons

## What supplements should you take?

NONE! Supplements might give you something like a 5% improvement. Also, some of them might be not healthy for you. In general, humanity hasn't been using supplements for long enough to have a definitive conclusion(s) about their safety.

Supplements have a positive side too. They can be used as partial meal replacements (mostly protein powders and gainers). A protein bar might save you some time when you're on the go or got some work to do.

Do you want to take some? Ok! Here is a list of some that might work for you:

- Protein powder
- Creatine
- Citrulline Malate
- Beta-Alanine

That's it. Most stuff they sell you don't work. Don't waste your money on it!
