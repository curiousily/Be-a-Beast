## Practical tips

- The most jacked person in your gym might have no clue about what proper training is
- You should probably not listen to the most non-jacked person, too!
- Never give unsolicited advice (no matter how good her/his booty is)
- Never make excessive noises (respect the other people that train)
- You might reach a point when the whole gym stops and looks at you doing a heavy set. This should never be your motivation to train.
