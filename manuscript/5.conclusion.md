# Your journey starts now

Thank you for reading this book! Can you do me a favor? Get your ass to the gym and grocery store! And keep doing it! No amount of knowledge will help you transform into a magical beast. You just have to get it done!

Workout out will help you clear your head, stay humble, and unleash your inner beast! Sometimes, you need to be a beast! You'll love it!

_Always be skeptical_. Even the fundamental truths described in this book can change. But training hard (with care) and eating relatively raw (after cooking) foods are time tested!

You might hear the new, most amazing supplement that comes up. Should you try it? NO! Wait for a couple of months or years. Wait for more research, more people trying it out. Fads tend to die out.

Stay safe, and keep training!

## Got more questions?

You'll learn more by doing than any other way. But there will be times you might feel clueless. Have a look at the "People to follow" section to dig into some good resources. You can also send me a question directly. Ask me any training, diet, and motivational question at [venelin@curiousily.com](venelin@curiousily.com).

## Practical tips

- The most jacked person in your gym might have no clue about what proper training is
- You should probably not listen to the most non-jacked person, too!
- Never give unsolicited advice (no matter how good her/his booty is)
- Never make excessive noises (respect the other people that train)
- You might reach a point when the whole gym stops and looks at you doing a heavy set. This should never be your motivation to train.

## People to follow

There are a lot of fake experts in the fitness community. In the beginning, your BS detector might not be well-calibrated. Fortunately, you can quickly learn some fundamentals and start thinking from first principles. Here are some of my favorite amazing people:
