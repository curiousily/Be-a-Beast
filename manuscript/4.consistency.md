# Consistency

## Motivation

## Dealing with injuries

## Hitting a plateau

## Your gains will slow down as you progress

## Keep your diet going

Put all the junk food you have in your house into the trash. If somebody else is buying it - tell them to keep it hidden from you. This will help a lot!

## You will fuck up

It's not a question of if, it's a question of when. You must be prepared. You might start having much more cheat meals, slack of the gym, and skip whole weeks.

Don't get me wrong. You must absolutely try to prevent this from happening. But when you screw things up - just continue where you left off.

Trying to lose weight and ate so much ice cream that you have no calories left? No more food for you on this day. You can also do 30 minutes of extra cardio.
