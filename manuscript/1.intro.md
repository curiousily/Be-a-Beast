# Becoming a Beast

The 3 pillars:

- Weight training
- Diet
- Consistency

Let me begin by clearing something up - there is no easy way to get the results you're seeking. There is, however, a lot of hard ways that will not give you the results, either.

Your body composition is highly dependant on your diet. You might have all the muscle you need, but with a layer of fat, you still got a lot of work.

## Train, don't exercise

"Now, I train to be healthy" - a colleague of mine said to me. "I want to become X and just maintain". No, you need to train and continue to improve!

In general, you want to set goals and strive to achieve them. Following the perfect diet and workout plan for a month or two will get you nowhere! Consistency is key! You should keep yourself motivated. Making progress towards your goals is one of the best ways to stay in the game!

## Man or a woman?

Prepare yourself for a shocker. Training, diet, and consistency should be no different based on your gender, age, or ethnicity. Of course, you should be cleared by your health professional to embark on this journey!

## Do you just want to lose fat?

No! Odds are, you want to look good, not skinny. That means low body fat percentage combined with a good amount of muscle. Of course, you should pack some fat in the right places, too!

## Should you sleep at the gym to get results?

No! You can start by spending 3 x 1h 30min per week, up that to 4 x 2 hours, and keep that up to 5+ years.

## Will you achieve your goals?

Yes, as long as you're reasonable with setting them! Look, your genetics will play a significant role in your journey. Still, you don't know your limits until you hit them! More importantly, no one can tell you what they are until you get there!

## Is weight training dangerous?

## Should you use Performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs)?

No! I haven't used them and can't advise you on the effects and side effects of these. Also, you shouldn't do anything illegal! That said, train for at least 5 years before seriously considering them.

In my opinion, recreational athletes shouldn't use this stuff - it requires a very knowledgeable coach, lots of cash, medical supervision, trusted source(s), and you still can't guarantee risk-free outcome!
