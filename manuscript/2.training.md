# Training

You should train more as you get more experienced. The [Repeated Bout Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_onset_muscle_soreness#Repeated-bout_effect) states roughly the following:

> The more you repeat an exercise, the easier it gets on your body. You adapt to it!

The training principles presented in this book have the following objective:

- Get you stronger on basic compound lifts (presses, squats, and deadlifts)
- Build muscle mass (and possibly reduce body fat)
- Keep you healthy (joints and connective tissue) in the long run
- Build self-efficacy and confidence

You can use the workout plan if:

- You are getting started with resistence training (less than 6 training experience)
- You are returning from injury
- You are returning from extended break (more than 4 weeks)

Here is a workout plan that you can start with:

- Focus on basic compound exercises (only barbells)
- Progression based on volume and intensity
- 3 workouts per week
- Conditioning (cardio)

You should select the weights as follows:

## Is there a perfect program?

No! More importantly, every freaking program you find on the internet is NOT personalized for you! After you have some training experience, only you and possibly your coach can design a workout program that is personalized for you.

Here's the kicker, though. You don't need the perfect program. You just need something that helps you make progress. Making consistent progress over a long period of training (years) will get you to your genetic limit (if such a thing exists). You might need 10+ years of hard training for that.

## Should you use a set of routines and just stick with those?

No, but you can use them as long as you are making progress (you use more weight for the same reps every 2-4 weeks). After that point, you can should for a proper program.

Finding a good workout template online might be harder than you think. The ones I can wholeheartedly recommend are:

- [Barbell Medicine Training Templates](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/shop/training-templates/)
- [RP Training Templates](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/rp-store/rp-templates?utf8=%E2%9C%93&filters_selected%5B%5D=&filters_selected%5B%5D=215)

I am in no way affiliated with those companies/people.

## How many sets and reps should you do?

There is no single/simple answer on this one. In general, you should do between 8 and 20 sets per muscle group per week. The range should be between 5 and 20 reps.

Some of the most effective programs play around with those numbers. You can read about this stuff called [periodization](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/periodization-history-theory/). Basically, this is a way to juggle between different goals at different stages at your training. It is a common practice to have different rep ranges and sets on different weeks/months in your training.

One simple way to do periodization in strength/hypertrophy training is to start with low volume and intensity. Then gradually (over a couple of weeks/months) try to push those up. You might end things with a deload or pivot week(s) and restart the process.

## Should you train 1 muscle group per week?

Probably not (scratch that if you are advanced/expert lifter). You should hit a muscle group 2-3 times a week. Let me clear something from the start. You might bench press multiple times per week with a single "heavy session". Other sessions might include incline bench press or dumbbells with a different rep range.

Have a look at those articles for more info:

## How long should you rest?

3-5 minutes on heavy sets (RPE 7 and above) on compound exercises (squats, presses, deadlifts), and 2-3 minutes on isolation exercises (bicep curls, tricep pushdowns, flyes, lateral raises). Most (if not all) work as a beginner should be composed of straight sets - with a lot of rest in between. Don't reduce your rest times (along with the weight)!

## Training hard

Unfortunatelly, exactly how hard you train is difficult to measure. Additionally, your performance will differ on different days. You might be able to bench 225lb for 10 today but only 215lb in a week. One tool to solve this problem is RPE.

In a resistance training context, Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) measures how hard a set is perceived to be. It was popularized and modified by [Mike Tuscherer](https://www.reactivetrainingsystems.com/Home/AboutUs).The RPE scale goes from 1 to 10. For example: if you aim at RPE 8, you should end the set with 2 reps left in the tank.

Unfortunately, you will not be good at estimating RPE at first. You might no be good after some training too. See [Self-Selected Resistance Exercise Load: Implications for Research and Prescription](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29112055). Well, you should train hard!

## Progressive overload

You have to make your workouts harder over time. You need more stress, not less! You don't need more recovery time! You need to go harder over time!

This should make sense. Adding another inch of muscle to your bicep, after training for 5+ years, can be done (if possible) by doing much more stressful workouts (drop sets, giant sets, metabolite work).

You can use volume and intensity to get more stimulus (more stress) from your workouts.

- Volume - _number of sets_ x _number of reps_
- Intensity - how close your set to failure is (RPE 10)

Unfortunately, going balls to the wall all the time is not a sustainable strategy. You accumulate too much fatigue and your performance drops dramatically. Those types of situations might require deload or pivot weeks.

Most good programs will try to balance the volume and intensity based on your goals. Its both art and science. When building muscle, you can stay at the 60-75% weight of your 1 rep max for a couple of weeks without the need for a deload. However, getting stronger might require a higher intensity.

### Excercise selection

### Frequency

### Volume

## How to warm up?

## Should you do cardio?

Yes, but don't go too hard on it! You can't build muscle while doing crazy cardio!

## Should you hire a coach?

Yes, if you can afford it. Second best option is to purchase templates done by people who understand how to build a program

## Can you build muscle without lifting heavy?

## Will you be stronger?

Yes, but strength is specific. You'll build strength only in the movement patterns you're exercising. I know this might be a shocker, but deadlifting will probably not increase your standing overhead press by much.
