# Training

You should train more as you get more experienced. The [Repeated Bout Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_onset_muscle_soreness#Repeated-bout_effect) states roughly the following:

> The more you repeat an exercise, the easier it gets on your body. You adapt to it!

The training principles presented in this book have the following objective:

- Get you stronger on basic compound lifts (presses, squats, and deadlifts)
- Build muscle mass (and possibly reduce body fat)
- Keep you healthy (joints and connective tissue) in the long run
- Build self-efficacy and confidence

Here is a workout plan that you can start with:
