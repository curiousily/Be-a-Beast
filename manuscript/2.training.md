# Training

You should train more as you get more experienced. The [Repeated Bout Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_onset_muscle_soreness#Repeated-bout_effect) states roughly the following:

> The more you repeat an exercise, the easier it gets on your body. You adapt to it!

The training principles presented in this book have the following objective:

- Get you stronger on basic compound lifts (presses, squats, and deadlifts)
- Build muscle mass (and possibly reduce body fat)
- Keep you healthy (joints and connective tissue) in the long run
- Build self-efficacy and confidence

You can use the workout plan if:

- You are getting started with resistence training (less than 6 training experience)
- You are returning from injury
- You are returning from extended break (more than 4 weeks)

Here is a workout plan that you can start with:

- Progression based on volume and intensity
- 3 workouts per week
- Conditioning (cardio)

You should select the weights as follows:

## Is there a perfect program?

No! More importantly, every freaking program you find on the internet is NOT personalized for you! After you have some training experience, only you and possibly your coach can design a workout program that is personalized for you.

Here's the kicker, though. You don't need the perfect program. You just need something that helps you make progress. Making consistent progress over a long period of training (years) will get you to your genetic limit (if such a thing exists). You might need 10+ years of hard training for that.

## Should you use a set of routines and just stick with those?

No, but you can use them as long as you are making progress (you use more weight for the same reps every 2-4 weeks). After that point, you can should for a proper program.

Finding a good workout template online might be harder than you think. The ones I can wholeheartedly recommend are:

- [Barbell Medicine Training Templates](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/shop/training-templates/)
- [RP Training Templates](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/rp-store/rp-templates?utf8=%E2%9C%93&filters_selected%5B%5D=&filters_selected%5B%5D=215)

I am in no way affiliated with those companies/people.

## How many sets and reps should you do?

## Should you train 1 muscle group per week?

Probably not (scratch that if you are advanced/expert lifter). You should hit a muscle group 2-3 times a week. Let me clear something from the start. You might bench press multiple times per week with a single "heavy session". Other sessions might include incline bench press or dumbbells with a different rep range.

Have a look at those articles for more info:

## How long should you rest?

3-5 minutes on heavy sets (RPE 7 and above) on compound exercises (squats, presses, deadlifts), and 2-3 minutes on isolation exercises (bicep curls, tricep pushdowns, flyes, lateral raises). Most (if not all) work as a beginner should be composed of straight sets - with a lot of rest in between. Don't reduce your rest times (along with the weight)!

## Progressive overload

### Training hard

RPE and RIR

### Excercise selection

### Frequency

### Volume

## How to warm up?

## Should you do cardio?

Yes, but don't go too hard on it! You can't build muscle while doing crazy cardio!

## Should you hire a coach?

Yes, if you can afford it. Second best option is to purchase templates done by people who understand how to build a program

## Can you build muscle without lifting heavy?

## Will you be stronger?

Yes, but strength is specific. You'll build strength only in the movement patterns you're exercising. I know this might be a shocker, but deadlifting will probably not increase your standing overhead press by much.
